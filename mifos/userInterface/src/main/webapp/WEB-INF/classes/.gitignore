# Please do not remove this otherwise empty directory.
#
# This src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/classes is needed so that Eclipse can compile
# into it. Normally this is not needed, but because the .classpath of MIFOS is
# a little special and needs to overlay web-content from two projects, and
# deletes the Output folder for each source folder on a full rebuild, this is
# required.
#
# http://mifosforge.jira.com/browse/MIFOS-3925 has some further background.
#
# This TXT serves to explain that, and ensure that SCM tools consider this
# empty directory.

# Best,
